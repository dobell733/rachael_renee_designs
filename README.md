# Art Quote Calculator

## Description
I created this snippet of code for my girlfriend's art company website. She created the website using GoDaddy and was happy with the way it looked but wanted a feature on the site for her customers to be able to put in specific parameters and receive a quote. The reason that the CSS and JS are all included in one HTML file is due to the way that you add personal code into a GoDaddy website. From what I could find, they only allow you to copy/paste HTML code so my work around was to just put everything in one HTML file and it ended up working great. It is still somewhat a work in progress and I would like to add more styling to the dropdowns in the future.

## Install
The only technologies used were HTML, CSS, and plain Javascript. The code could be edited for various needs and copy/pasted into GoDaddy websites or could be put in seperate files for use in a regular website.
